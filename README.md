# CMSC320 Final Project/Tutorial: Movement of an Aldabra Giant Tortoise
By Erin Hopper

<h3>Project Summary and Data</h3>

This project will analyze the [movement data of a Aldabra giant tortoise](https://github.com/erinhopper/CMSC320FinalProjectHopper/blob/main/tortoise.csv) (<i>Aldabrachelys giganteam</i>) over a 14-day time period, which consists of about 990,000 locations at one second intervals. It was collected via accelerometer, magnetometer, and GPS in 2018. The data is very thorough and clean, and the specific nature (one indivdual over as short period of time) will allow for thorough analysis. Specific movement data like this reveals many truths about the animal, particularly what locations are important to them, as well as habits and important activities, though such dense and thorough movement data can be difficult to find.

Furthermore, this data is being used in the 2024 MoveModel competition, so preliminary analysis through this project will prepare me to submit to this competition.
